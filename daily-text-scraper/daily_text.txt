Scripture:
O Jehovah, hear my prayer; listen to my plea for help.​—Ps. 143:1.
Daily Text:
Jehovah answered David’s prayers for deliverance. (1 Sam. 19:10, 18-20; 2 Sam. 5:17-25) We too can have that assurance. (Ps. 145:18) Jehovah may not answer our prayers in the way that we expect. Paul asked God to remove “a thorn in the flesh.” On three occasions, Paul prayed specifically about this difficult problem. Did Jehovah answer those prayers? Yes, but not in the way that Paul had hoped. Instead of removing the problem, Jehovah gave him the power that he needed to keep serving Him faithfully. (2 Cor. 12:7-10) We too may at times receive an answer that differs from what we expect. We can be sure that Jehovah knows exactly how best to help us. He can even “do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive.” (Eph. 3:20) For that reason, his answer to our prayers could come at a time or in a way that we do not anticipate. w23.05 8-9 ¶4-6
