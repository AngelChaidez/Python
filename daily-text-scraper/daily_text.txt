Scripture:
Let your reasonableness become known to all men.​—Phil. 4:5.
Daily Text:
Elders must set a good example in being reasonable. (1 Tim. 3:2, 3) For instance, an elder should not expect that his opinions will always be accepted simply because he is older than the other elders. He realizes that Jehovah’s spirit can move any member of the body to make an expression that contributes to a wise decision. And if no Bible principle is violated, reasonable elders willingly support the decision of the majority on the body, even if they had preferred a different decision. Christians reap many blessings by being reasonable. We enjoy better relationships with our brothers and sisters, and the congregation enjoys peace. We find delight in the beautiful variety of personalities and customs among Jehovah’s united worshippers. Above all, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are imitating our reasonable God, Jehovah. w23.07 25 ¶16-17
